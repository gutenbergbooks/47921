<h3 class="no-break"><b>THE WORK OF<br />
SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN.</b></h3>






<p class="p2">During the reign of James I. the
Renaissance style in England,
which in Elizabeth's time had been
mingled in picturesque combination with
the Gothic, was further developed, losing
year by year more of the Gothic features
and becoming purer as the Classic models
and literature became better known. The
Anglo-Classic, or fully evolved English
Renaissance style, arose only, however,
with the advent of the celebrated Inigo
Jones, who brought to his work the fruits
of long study in Italy, and a thorough
knowledge of the work of Palladio who
was his master in design. During his life
Jones' influence was paramount, and up to
the time of the Commonwealth he had a
practical monopoly of the architectural
profession in England. His work was
taken up where he left it by an architect
on the whole, more remarkable&mdash;one of
the most remarkable figures, indeed, that
architecture has produced&mdash;Sir Christopher
Wren, whose influence after the Restoration
was even more complete than that
of Jones had been before it. No building
of importance was erected in England during
the last forty years of the seventeenth
century, of which Wren was not the architect.
To Americans, moreover, Wren's
work has an especial interest. Our own
Colonial style, particularly in the architecture
of churches, was in no slight degree
based upon models which he originated, and
he has not without justification been called
the "father of the American Colonial style."</p>

<p>Sir Christopher Wren was born at East
Knoyle, Wiltshire, on October 20, 1632. He
was the son of Christopher Wren, rector
of East Knoyle. He early showed a taste
for natural science and mathematics, and
up to his twenty-ninth year devoted himself
with great genius to scientific pursuits.
His fame rests chiefly on his architectural
achievements, but had his philosophical
pursuits not been interfered with by the
arduous profession to which he later devoted
himself he could not have failed of
securing a scientific position higher than
that attained by any of his contemporaries,
with of course one exception, Newton.
Hooke in his "Micrographia" wrote of
him, "I must affirm that scarce ever met
in one man such a mechanical hand and so
philosophical a mind." He made elaborate
drawings to illustrate the anatomy of the
brain, invented an instrument for planting,
a method of making fresh water at sea,
produced a scheme for the graphical construction
of solar and lunar eclipses and
occultation of stars, and solved a problem
proposed by Pascal to the geometers of
England. The practical use of the barometer
as connected with the weather is attributed
to him, though it was not commonly
used as a weather glass until a much later
date. He invented a method for transfusion
of blood, experimented scientifically in
the force of gunpowder, and made innumerable
other like experiments and inventions.</p>

<p>The first definite information we have of
his applying himself professionally to architecture,
is his acceptance in his twenty-ninth
year of an invitation from Charles II.
to act practically as surveyor-general to
his majesty's works, though nominally as
assistant to Sir Charles Denham. It is
clear, however, that he must have already
given proof of fitness before such an appointment
could have been offered.</p>

<p>The two earliest original works we hear
of are the chapel of Pembroke College
Cambridge, built at the expense of his
uncle, and the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford.
The chapel was finished in two years,
but the Sheldonian Theatre not till 1669.
We may therefore take Pembroke Chapel
as his first original work, and it need occasion
no surprise if we find in it signs of
the 'prentice hand. Wren evidently felt
the need of better opportunities for study,
and took the earliest opportunity available
to him to supply it by his journey to Paris
in 1665, when ordinary business in London
and in other parts of England was interrupted
by the plague. This journey to
France, where he seems to have resided
for about six months, is the only one of
which any information exists.</p>

<p>The architectural detail of the Sheldonian
Theatre, though still not commendable,
is much in advance of that of Pembroke
Chapel; but its completion did not take
place until 1669, and Wren had had by then
more time for education in correct classical
expression. He was thus in some
measure prepared both by study and by
practical experience when the great opportunity
of his life presented itself. The
great fire of London broke out in 1666.</p>

<p>Before the embers of the great fire had
cooled, Wren, as virtual surveyor-general,
had prepared a scheme for the rebuilding
of the city. The fire raged from the
second to the eighth of September, and
during those six days, four hundred and
sixty entire streets, eighty-nine churches,
and over thirteen thousand houses were
swept away. On the twelfth of September,
Wren laid before the king a sketch
plan of his design for the restoration of the
metropolis. It is the plan of what would
have become a magnificent city, but the
public spirit which would have been required
to carry it out would have demanded
great sacrifices of present interest for the
sake of future benefit; and a more hand-to-mouth
expedient was necessarily adopted.
But Wren found employment enough in
his official capacity in designing, supervising
and rebuilding a cathedral, more
than fifty parish churches, thirty-six of the
Companies' halls, the custom house, beside
several private houses and provincial
works.</p>

<p>In regard to the Cathedral, Wren gave an
unhesitating opinion that nothing but an
entirely new structure ought to be contemplated.
This advice was not at once taken,
but the fall of a part of the Cathedral where
repair was being attempted gave convincing
proof of the wisdom of his judgment, and
in 1668 he was summoned to London from
Oxford (where he was still a professor of
astronomy) to advise respecting a new
edifice. The taking down of the old
walls&mdash;in which Wren was wonderfully
ingenious in inventing devices,&mdash;lasted
through part of 1668; and in 1673 Wren,
who had meantime been knighted, submitted
his first design for the new Cathedral,&mdash;a
design which he himself wrote
that he considered "antique and well
studied, conformable to the best style of
Greek and Roman architecture." The king
greatly approved of
it, and a commencement
of it was actually
made, but so
much clerical opposition
was brought
to bear on account
of its being different
from the usual cathedral
shape that
Wren was reluctantly
obliged to turn
his thoughts in
another direction;
and he proceeded
with several trial
plans in Gothic
form. One of these
was accepted, and
he was ordered by
a royal commission,
dated May, 1675, to
proceed with it.
The authorization
was accompanied by
the permission to
make variations,
"rather ornamental
than essential"; but
happily, as the
whole was left to
his management, he
found himself able
to make use of this permission without
troubling himself as to the qualification as
to essentials.</p>

<p>There is no concealing the point that if the
design which the king's warrant authorized
had been carried out unaltered, St. Paul's
would, externally at least, have proved a
gigantic failure. In design we may perceive
that there was in Wren's mind a
struggle between two ideas as respects
the great central feature of the dome,&mdash;namely,
that of retaining the fine and well
studied internal proportions of his first
design, and at the same time attaining the
quality of great loftiness demanded for the
external appearance. This he proposed to
attain by means of a lofty spire; but before
long he abandoned this attempt and adopted
the idea of general height as the leading
principle, by which he ultimately arrived
at the unrivalled exterior of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>Now that he was fully authorized to proceed,
Wren devoted all his energies to
maturing his design, and many studies are
extant which show
the steps by which
he arrived at the
final result. He
had no doubt a sufficiently
clear general
idea in his mind's
eye of what the
complete structure
should be, but these
studies show that
the details of even
such essential features
as the profile
of the dome and
the western towers
were not settled until
the time approached
when they
would be required.</p>

<p>For thirty-five
years work was continued
on the immense
edifice, the
third largest church
in Christendom,
under Wren's sole
supervision, and in
1710 Sir Christopher,
who had been
a year old when the
first stone was laid,
now laid the last
stone of the lantern above the dome. The
scene could hardly be better painted than
in the works of Dean Milman:</p>

<p>"All London had poured forth for the
spectacle, which had been publicly announced,
and were looking up in wonder to
the old man ... who was on that wondrous
height setting the seal, as it were, to
his august labors. If in that wide circle
which his eye might embrace there were various
objects for regret and disappointment;
if, instead of beholding the various streets
of the city, each converging to its centre,
London had sprung up and spread in irregular
labyrinths of close, dark, intricate
lanes; if even his own Cathedral was
crowded upon and jostled by mean and unworthy
buildings; yet, on the other hand,
he might survey, not the Cathedral only,
but a number of stately churches which
had risen at his command and taken form
and dignity from his genius and skill. On
one side the picturesque steeple of St. Mary-le-Bow;
on the other the exquisite tower
of St. Bride's. Beyond, and on all sides, if
more dimly seen, yet discernible by his
partial eyesight (he might even penetrate
to the inimitable interior of St. Stephen's
Walbrook), church after church, as far as
St. Dunstan's-in-the-East, perhaps Greenwich,
may have been vaguely made out in
the remote distance; and all this one man
had been permitted to conceive and execute;
a man not originally destined or educated
for an architect, but compelled as it were
by the public necessities to assume the
office, and so to fulfil it as to stand on a
level with the most consummate masters
of the art in Europe, and to take his stand
on an eminence which his English successors
almost despaired of attaining."</p>

<p>Temple Bar was rebuilt from his designs
about 1670-72. This historic Bar had formerly
served as a sort of official entrance to
the city, and when the reigning sovereign
visited London on state occasions he was
wont, in accordance with an ancient custom,
to wait there till the Lord Mayor
gave him permission to pass it,&mdash;a formal
acknowledgment of the rights of the freemen
of the city. (The photograph of Sir
Christopher's Temple Bar shown in <a href="#LXXXIX">Plate
<span class="smcap">LXXXIX.</span></a> was made in 1877, one year before
the arch was demolished to permit the
widening of the street.) In 1684 Wren was
appointed by Charles II. as comptroller of
works in the Castle of Windsor, and besides
all these spheres of activity he took
some part in politics, and was three times
elected to parliament.</p>

<p>Of the fifty-two churches which Wren
built in London, and of which a considerable
number have been demolished, every
one that remains is a valuable study in
planning, and they show the greatest skill
in their adaptation to irregular sites and
their suitability for Protestant worship.
In all of them the main proportions are excellent,
but minor details are not in all
good alike. Nothing that has been achieved
in modern architecture has surpassed the
beauty of their spires, not only from the
elegance of each, but from their complete
variety, and at the same time their harmony
with one another. Indeed Wren may
be called the inventor of the English Renaissance
type of steeple, in which a conical
or pyramidal spire is harmoniously added
to belfry on a square tower with classical
details. Two of these churches in particular
are especially good examples of his
genius,&mdash;namely St. Mary-le-Bow and St.
Stephen's Walbrook.</p>

<p>St. Mary-le-Bow, or simply Bow church
(so named after an earlier church on the
same site, borne upon stone arches, or
"bows"), was one of the most historic
structures of old London. "Bow bells"
hung in its tower, and served the city as a
curfew; and persons born within the sound
of them were considered true Londoners
or "cockneys." Sir Christopher's church
on the same site and called by the same
name, was commenced in 1671 and completed
six years later. The exterior is so
much closed in with houses that only a
plain solid outside was required, and Wren
expended his chief architectural effort on
a steeple, of which Mr. Fergusson has
written: "There are errors of detail which
probably the architect himself would have
avoided in a second attempt, and, as they
arose only from an imperfect knowledge of
classical details, might easily be remedied
at the present day. It only wants this
slight revision to harmonize what little incongruities
remain, and, if this were done,
this steeple might challenge comparison
with any Gothic example ever erected. No
modern steeple can compare with it either
for beauty of outline or the appropriateness
with which classical details are applied
to so novel a purpose."</p>

<p>St. Stephen's Walbrook, commenced in
1672 and finished in 1679, like St. Mary-le-Bow
has a plain exterior, and for the same
reason; but Fergusson has rightly praised
the interior for its originality, and as "the
most pleasing of any Renaissance church
that has yet been erected." The plain
exterior tower was surmounted by a beautiful
spire. One of Wren's principles was,
that when sufficient funds were not available
for the elaboration of the whole of a
design, some one or more important features
should be worked up to a higher
standard than the rest, instead of adopting
a lower standard for the whole.</p>

<p>Another of Wren's most admired steeples
is that for St. Bride's in Fleet Street, built
in 1701. The upper stories of it have,
however, been criticised because of their
sameness and the want of connection between
them. Another famous spire is that
which he built in 1699 for the church of St.
Dunstan's-in-the-East.</p>

<p>In 1698 Wren was appointed surveyor to
Westminster Abbey, and proceeded to
carry out very important repairs. He
built the central tower as we see it, and
intended that it should have been surmounted
by a lofty spire. The western
towers which formed part of the project
have been built, but not as he intended.
The general proportion of the towers alone
is Wren's.</p>

<p>The "Monument," the Roman Doric
column which commemorates the great
fire, was built by Wren, between 1671 and
1678. He had at first intended that it
should be left hollow from top to bottom
to serve as a vertical telescope tube for
astronomical purposes, but its height
proved insufficient for this. There was
great debate about the ornament for the
summit. Wren wished it to be a large
statue as "carrying much dignity with it,
and being more valuable in the eyes of
foreigners and strangers," but this project
was abandoned on account of the expense,
and the present ornament, a flaming vase
of gilt bronze, substituted. "The great inequality
of Wren's achievement," writes
Fergusson, "is nowhere more marked than
in a comparison of this Monument, which is
one of the most successful Classical columns
that have been erected in Europe, with
Temple Bar, which is perhaps the most
unsuccessful attempt ever made to reproduce
a Classical triumphal archway."</p>

<p>In 1677 he commenced the library of
Trinity College, Cambridge. The work,
which was not finished till 1692, is one of
the handsomest buildings in England, remarkable
externally for breadth and correctness
of style, and internally as a model
of excellent arrangement. In design it is
not unlike the much admired Library of
Ste. Genéviève in Paris. To Greenwich
Hospital he contributed gratuitously the
design for two noble blocks of buildings
completely in harmony with the earlier
portion by Inigo Jones.</p>

<p>He was long engaged on extensive works
on Hampton Court Palace, where, at the
desire of Queen Mary, the old buildings
were in part pulled down and two sets
of royal apartments built. The queen,
though she amused herself with planning
the gardens and making suggestions, had
yet the wisdom to defer to Wren's better
taste and knowledge. Her husband, with
characteristic obstinacy, insisted on his
own ideas, thereby dwarfing the cloisters
and marring much of the architecture. It
is, however, fair to say that King William
always owned that the defects were his,
the merits, Wren's; and these merits are
very great, for in spite of defects of detail,
the general design is one remarkable for
dignity and breadth of conception.</p>

<p>Having been appointed by the Stuarts to
the office of surveyor-general, Wren retained
the royal favor unclouded through
the reigns of William and Mary, and Queen
Anne; but on the accession of the Hanoverian
family in 1714, the jealousies which
his high position had created were able to
prevail against him. At first he was subjected
to repeated annoyances, but, after
having endured these for four years, during
which time he was able to complete the
fabric of St. Paul's, he was finally superseded
in 1718. Wren after this retired from
practical business (he was eighty-six years
old), retaining only the supervision of
Westminster Abbey, which he held until
his death.</p>

<p>For the last five years of his life Wren
resided much at his house in Hampton
Court, which he held on a lease from the
crown. Once a year it was his habit to be
driven to London and to sit for a while
under the dome of his own Cathedral; on
one of these journeys he caught a cold, and
soon afterwards, on February 25, 1723, his
servant, thinking Sir Christopher slept
longer after dinner than was his wont, came
into the room, and found his master dead in
his chair. He was ninety-one years old.
On the fifth of March he was buried in St.
Paul's Cathedral, under the south aisle of
the choir, and in his honor an inscription
was placed at the entrance to the choir
ending with the words, "Si monumentum
requiris, circumspice."</p>

<p>Sir Christopher's personal appearance
is only known to us through pictures: it
appears that he was mild yet dignified of
countenance, and "thin and low of stature."</p>

<p>"Though he did fail sometimes," writes
Mr. Fergusson, "it cannot be denied that
Wren was a giant in architecture, and,
considering the difficulties he had to contend
with, not only from the age in which
he lived, but from the people he had to
deal with, and the small modicum of taste
or knowledge that prevailed anywhere, we
may well be astonished at what he did
accomplish that was good, rather than
wonder at his occasional failures. His
greatest praise, however, is, that though
he showed the way and smoothed the path,
none of his successors have surpassed&mdash;if,
indeed, any have equalled&mdash;him in what
he did, though more than a century has
now elapsed since his death, and numberless
opportunities have been offered in
every department of architectural art."</p>
